abstract = {In the practical application of light-field (LF) images, researchers are often plagued by the problem of low spatial resolution. In this study, we propose a novel method for super-resolution of LF images that uses both the macro-pixel image (MacPI) and the sub-aperture image (SAI) of the LF. The MacPI is considered to contain rich angular information that can be used to enhance the super-resolution effect. In addition, in order to maintain the edge features of the image, we introduce the edge map into the condition network to generate prior conditions together with the MacPI. Specifically, we design a feature affine-transformation module that uses the conditions as input to obtain affine-transformation parameters, which guide the features extracted from the SAIs in the backbone network. Additionally, the network uses the features of the central SAI combined with the affine-transformed backbone network features to enhance the super-resolution effect. Finally, the super-resolution LF image is recovered using an up-sampling network. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive with other mainstream models in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluation.}

ABSTRACT = {Vertical farming is on its way to becoming an addition to conventional agricultural practices, improving sustainable food production for the growing world population under increasing climate stress. While the early development of vertical farming systems mainly focused on technological advancement through design innovation, the automation of hydroponic cultivation, and advanced LED lighting systems, more recent studies focus on the resilience and circularity of vertical farming. These sustainability objectives are addressed by investigating water quality and microbial life in a hydroponic cultivation context. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have been shown to improve plant performance and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. The application of PGPRs to plant-growing media increases microbial functional diversity, creating opportunities to improve the circularity and resilience of vertical farming systems by reducing our dependency on chemical fertilizers and crop protection products. Here, we give a brief historical overview of vertical farming, review its opportunities and challenges in an economic, environmental, social, and political context, and discuss advances in exploiting the rhizosphere microbiome in hydroponic cultivation systems.},

abstract = {The hydroponic Farming System is considered an alternative to conventional farming systems to reduce water requirements. The hydroponic farming system is beneficial, especially in areas with severe soil degradation and limited water availability. This farming method also proves eco-friendly due to no requirement of pesticides and less water requirement. There are many challenges faced by the conventional farming method, i.e.,Soil. A few are climate change, urbanization, increased use of fertilizers, and natural calamities that can’t be prevented. In contrast,the hydroponic farming system doesn’t need to face any of the challenges mentioned above, as this farming system can also be a multi-story farming system only by grounding the stands. In this report, we will observe the different benefits and limitations of the hydroponic farming system through the cultivation of different crops like coriander and leafy vegetables. Less time is required for the yield, and no soil-borne diseases. Easy management of crops, zero growth of weeds, and no requirement for spraying water are among the few advantages of the hydroponic farming system that we will discuss further in this report. A hydroponic farming system can assure minimum water savings of up to 70–80% compared to that of soil-based farming systems. This paper explains Hydroponic farming's importance, advantages, and disadvantages.}

abstract = {Container farms (CFs), integrating plant factories into mobile prefabricated buildings, are emerging as a novel decentralized food production system to fortify sustainable urban development. However, the high energy demand needs to be optimized to promote wider CF application. This study investigates the energy efficiency of CFs in various climates, covering eight ASHRAE climate zones. The CF energy model was developed in the building energy simulation program EnergyPlus, fed with plant (lettuce) growth data measured from a real case. Four energy-saving methods were evaluated, with how different climates impact their potential. The results show that, in colder climates, the CF energy demand is lower and energy-saving methods are more effective. Air-side economizers reduce CF cooling demand by 3.5–58.3% from the hottest to coldest regions. Shifting lighting schedules into nocturnal lighting, as a cost-free method, reduces HVAC energy demand by up to 19.4% and can further reinforce the effectiveness of air-side economizers. The optimal envelope U-values should be among 0.5–3 W/m2-K, without being either poorly or overly insulated. Improving lighting efficacy can save over 20% total energy demand by reducing intense lighting power. We conclude that locating CFs in colder climates presents greater potential in energy conservation along with benefits for improving urban sustainability. The results can support decision-making for cleaner CF design and operation, and the methodology could be replicated to other indoor food production systems.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The growth of the mobile Internet, smartphones and social networks has brought in huge amounts of picture information, and traditional manual identification is not able to meet the demand well enough. Therefore, the automatical image recognition [1] has been proposed which can help us recognize the image efficiently and get the corresponding information. Although traditional machine learning methods [2] have already been widely used in the field of image recognition, most of these methods are designed to handle one-dimensional vector information. Thus, we should first stretch image matrix to one-dimensional vector or extract features from images to employ traditional image recognition methods, which would lose the adjacent information in images and miss some important features. With the development of computer technology, deep learning [3] is gradually applied to the field of image recognition. It can deal with two-dimensional image data naturally and extract features automatically. Compared with the traditional machine learning methods, deep learning is popular for its good learning ability and low generalization error. In this paper, we compare the differences between SVM [4] and deep learning on image recognition, with an application to handwritten digital images recognition. The results show that the deep learning method is more accurate and more stable in image recognition.}
