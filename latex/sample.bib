@book{wolfram,
  abstract = {{Physics and computer science genius Stephen Wolfram, whose Mathematica computer language launched a multimillion-dollar company, now sets his sights on a more daunting goal: understanding the universe. Wolfram lets the world see his work in <I>A New Kind of Science</I>, a gorgeous, 1,280-page tome more than a decade in the making. With patience, insight, and self-confidence to spare, Wolfram outlines a fundamental new way of modeling complex systems.<p>  On the frontier of complexity science since he was a boy, Wolfram is a  champion of cellular automata--256 "programs" governed by simple  nonmathematical rules. He points out that even the most complex  equations fail to accurately model biological systems, but the simplest  cellular automata can produce results straight out of nature--tree  branches, stream eddies, and leopard spots, for instance. The graphics  in <I>A New Kind of Science</I> show striking resemblance to the  patterns we see in nature every day.<p>  Wolfram wrote the book in a distinct style meant to make it easy to read,   even for nontechies; a basic familiarity with logic is helpful but  not essential. Readers will find themselves swept away by the elegant  simplicity of Wolfram's ideas and the accidental artistry of the  cellular automaton models. Whether or not Wolfram's revolution  ultimately gives us the keys to the universe, his new science is  absolutely awe-inspiring. <I>--Therese Littleton</I>} {This long-awaited work from one of the world's most respected scientists presents a series of dramatic discoveries never before made public. Starting from a collection of simple computer experiments---illustrated in the book by striking computer graphics---Wolfram shows how their unexpected results force a whole new way of looking at the operation of our universe.  <P>Wolfram uses his approach to tackle a remarkable array of fundamental problems in science: from the origin of the Second Law of thermodynamics, to the development of complexity in biology, the computational limitations of mathematics, the possibility of a truly fundamental theory of physics, and the interplay between free will and determinism.  <P>Written with exceptional clarity, and illustrated by more than a thousand original pictures, this seminal book allows scientists and non-scientists alike to participate in what promises to be a major intellectual revolution.}},
