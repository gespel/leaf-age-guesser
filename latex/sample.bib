abstract = {In the practical application of light-field (LF) images, researchers are often plagued by the problem of low spatial resolution. In this study, we propose a novel method for super-resolution of LF images that uses both the macro-pixel image (MacPI) and the sub-aperture image (SAI) of the LF. The MacPI is considered to contain rich angular information that can be used to enhance the super-resolution effect. In addition, in order to maintain the edge features of the image, we introduce the edge map into the condition network to generate prior conditions together with the MacPI. Specifically, we design a feature affine-transformation module that uses the conditions as input to obtain affine-transformation parameters, which guide the features extracted from the SAIs in the backbone network. Additionally, the network uses the features of the central SAI combined with the affine-transformed backbone network features to enhance the super-resolution effect. Finally, the super-resolution LF image is recovered using an up-sampling network. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive with other mainstream models in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluation.}
